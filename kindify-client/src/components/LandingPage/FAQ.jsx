      question: 'How do I know the NGOs on Kindify are legitimate?',
      answer: 'All NGOs on our platform undergo a rigorous verification process. We verify their legal registration, financial statements, impact reports, and conduct background checks. Only organizations that meet our strict criteria are approved to receive donations.'
    },

      question: 'Is my donation secure and protected?',

      question: 'How do I get started with donating?',
      answer: 'Getting started is easy! Simply browse our verified NGOs, choose a cause that resonates with you, select your donation amount, and complete the secure payment process. You can start with as little as â‚¹100 and make a real difference.'
